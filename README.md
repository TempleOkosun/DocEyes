<h2> A tamper proof document storage system </h2>

<h2> Project Description </h2>
Information is the cornerstone for doing business and tampering or leaking it can have devastating consequences.
<hr>

<h2> Motivation </h2>
The motivation for this project is to address a seemingly small and often neglected but important
activity for many businesses while developing the skills acquired through the blockchain development program 
at George Brown College and finally as part of the requirement for the fulfillment of the DAPPII course.
<hr>


<h2> Problem </h2>
Data is one of the most critical assets of an organization and usually prime targets of an attacker. 
Data tampering can have severe consequences on an organization. Many organization today rely on shared folders or some 
repo for storing data with valuable transaction details. Effectively monitoring such repo to detect either intended or 
unintended modification is very important.
<hr>

<h2> Goal </h2>
The goal of this project is to develop a system which secures documents and files using blockchain. This will help to 
quickly detect data tampering and restore modified files from a distributed storage (IPFS). 
The above goal gives rise to the following core project objectives.
<hr>

<ul>
    <li> To review literature and evaluate similar tools</li>
    <li> To design, develop, implement and appraise a tool for tamper-proof document storage </li>
</ul>


<h2> Measuring Success </h2>
<ul>
    <li> A user should be able to see list of files being monitored </li>
    <li> Modification should be detected with 5secs and user alerted. </li>
    <li> User should be able to take action. Accept modification or restore from ipfs.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Benefits </h2>
<ul>
    <li> <strong> Security:  </strong> Blockchain’s inherent property of immutability is used to establish the trusted 
        baseline to compare latest versions of documents
    </li>
     <li> <strong> Build Trust: </strong> Information can be accessible to any partner of the organization authorized 
        to do so – which provides maximum transparency.
    </li>
      <li> <strong> Efficiency: </strong> Modular structure and utilizes asynchronous programming concept to speed up 
        monitoring and reporting which is usually resource intensive.
    </li>
</ul>
